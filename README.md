# Software Engineering Assignment 1

## Tools
1. Language Used: Python 3.7
2. Target Language: Python
3. Editor Used: PyCharm
4. Dependencies: sys, ast, re libraries
5. Test File: complexity.py

## Execution
On the terminal type:
git clone https://github.com/Sreya8/Software_Engineering.git

Navigate to the directory Software_Engineering

Run the following command:
> ````python3 complexity_counter.py <Name_of_input_file.py> <Name_of_output_file>````

To run the code with the files uploaded use:
> ````python3 complexity_counter.py complexity.py results.txt````</br>
or </br>
> ````python complexity_counter.py complexity.py results.txt````

## Sample Output
Using the sample complexity.py file, the following is the output :
>````abc:````</br>
>````   - cyclomatic: 2````</br>
>````   - ifc: 4````</br>
>````xyz:````</br>
>````   - cyclomatic: 3````</br>
>````   - ifc: 1````</br>
>````another_function:````</br>
>````   - cyclomatic: 4````</br>
>````   - ifc: 9````</br>
>````one_more_function:````</br>
>````   - cyclomatic: 3````</br>
>````   - ifc: 36````</br>
>````main:````</br>
>````   - cyclomatic: 3````</br>
>````   - ifc: 0````</br>
